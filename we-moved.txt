All static content has been moved to a second repo to mitigate the potential damage that would occur if someone were to get ahold of the token. With this secondary repo only the content file can be messed with as opposed to the entire site files. Interestingly we can also create trip-wires that auto-detect abuse. By putting a small file or value, we can reject/accept based on the presence of this value (which an attacker would not know). Sure they could figure it out via trial and error but we could also account for this by locking down the site if 3 - 5 failures were to happen in a row.
